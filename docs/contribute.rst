Understand the GIT workflow
---------------------------

Branches:

- **Master:** stable releases. Here are only the official stable releases.
- **Develop:** main development branch. Use this if you want to test the new features or for contribute.

**Release** candidate versions are tagged ``release-X`` where ``X`` will be the final version. Try release versions for bleeding edge code or to help to debug the code before the official release.
