If you develop in PHP since years, you will find in Phraw a very elastic environment and less limits as possibile: you can use your preferred libraries and customize all the parts of the system.

Why a "micro" framework?
------------------------

A "micro" framework have an opposite view rather than a full stack framework. A full stack framework gives you a complete system ready to use but needs to read long documentations and limits you on what you can done. It's difficult to push a traditional framework over their limits.

The philosophy of a micro framework is to give the bare minimum of features, so you have less to learn, and leverage on third party libraries. Often a micro framework is easier to use, faster and with less limits. Phraw is a micro framework so you can make simple web sites in less time but also build big web applications where a traditional framework may be a limit.

Phraw is more like a library where you can pick what you want and use powerful third party libraries of your chose: your code is the glue so you can customize and optimize for the original behavior that you have in mind. Phraw is fully customizable and suggest you a basic folder structure, some templating systems and a replaceable routing mechanism.
